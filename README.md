===============

A client library for use with the FloJack NFC reader.

Installing
----------------
The FloJackExample directory is an Android Studio (Intellij) project.  Simply 
launch Android Studio and select "Open Project".

Click build and deploy on your Android device of choice.  Min version supported 
is Android v4.0 (API14), but it's built all the way to v4.1.2 (API16).  If your 
running a newer version of Android, you'll have to build it for that target SDK.
